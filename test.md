|Drive Modes and Continuous Shooting Speed|(1) Single shooting (2)High-speed continuous shooting • Max. approx. 8.0 fps ! The conditions are attaining the maximum continuous shooting speed are as follows: ! Shooting with a fully charged battery in One-Shot AF mode at a 1/1000 sec. or faster shutter speed and maximum aperture (depending on the lens), at room temperature (73°F/23°C), with flicker reduction, Dual Pixel RAW shooting and Digital Lens Optimizer disabled. ! In One-Shot AF mode with Image Stabilizer off when using these lenses: EF 300mm f/4L IS USM, EF 28–135mm f/3.5–5.6 IS USM, EF 75–300mm f/4–5.6 IS USM, EF 100–400mm f/4.5–5.6L IS USM. ! The continuous shooting speed for high-speed continuous shooting may be lower, depending on conditions such as these: battery level, temperature, flicker reduction, Dual Pixel RAW shooting, shutter speed, aperture, subject conditions, brightness, AF operation, type of lens, use of flash and shooting settings. ! The maximum continuous shooting speed may be lower when using a cold battery in cold environments or when the battery level is low, at approx. 6.0 shots/sec. • With Servo AF: Max. approx. 5.0 fps (shooting speed priority) [Silent LV shooting: Mode 1] ! With Servo AF, the maximum continuous shooting speed may become slower depend- ing on subject conditions or the lens used. Also, the maximum continuous shooting speed will become slower when setting the [LV silent shooting] to [Disable]. (3) Low-speed continuous shooting (Tracking priority) • Max. approx. 3.0 fps • With Dual Pixel RAW: Max. approx. 2.2 fps ! High-speed continuous shooting not possible. (4) Self-timer: 10 sec./remote control (5) Self-timer: 2 sec./remote control|
